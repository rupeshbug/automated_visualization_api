## Automated Visualization API Integration

This repository contains a Flask API designed for generating automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports using the Sweetviz library. 
The API has been integrated into a Next.js project as part of a university assignment, allowing users to upload CSV files and receive detailed EDA reports directly through the web interface.

### Key Points
- Automated EDA Reports: Users can upload a CSV file, and the API will generate a comprehensive report including visualizations, summaries, and key insights.
- Next.js Integration: The API is seamlessly integrated into the Next.js frontend, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading files and viewing reports.
- Real-time Report Generation: The Next.js app communicates with the Flask API to process files and display the resulting HTML report within the application.
